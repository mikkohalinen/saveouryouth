Save, our youth - a student project for the Building AI course by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor.

## Summary
Proactively advise and educate teenagers and young adults in particular to stay on top of their financial life through anonomous analysis of their credit card and bank account use in a compliant and user-friendly manner.

## Background
* 500 000 people in Finland are have claims in distraint ("Ulosotto) on a yearly basis (source: https://www.mtkl.fi/)
* Financial issues impact not only impact ability to f. ex. rent an appartment or get a phone subscription, but also mental wellbeing (source: https://www.mtkl.fi/)
* To succeed, responsible financial service providers rely on customers who can manage their personal finances

## How is it used?
Process pseudonymous transaction data, identifying patterns that can lead into issues with managing personal finance. Create an engine which banks and financial institutions can integrate into their consumer-facing applications and build personalized proactive communications educating especially younger users on the fundamentals of personal economy. Imperative that solution is compliant with personal data protection legislation, PSD2 directive among others.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data on transactions would need to be provided by service providers (banks, credit card companies) and due to privacy and compliance requirements, likely processed in their environments. Machine learning systems would need to be trained to recognize risk behavior by having test data that simulates such patterns.

## Challenges
As such, the project doesn't prevent anyone from running into financial issues but requires users' motivation to acknowledge the warning signs. Experts in education and behavioral sciences are needed to plan communications for different opportunities identified by the engine. People's financial data is highly sensitive and needs to be treated with highest level of confidentiality and privacy.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
To evolve from a naive idea into an actual concept and possibly a real product at some point, various expertise and skills would be required. To begin with, expertise in financial technologies and their regulation is required to define if the project is feasible at all. If it is, further expertise in integrations with service providers as well as data science expertise is required.
